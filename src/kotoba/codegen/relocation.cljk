(defn- printable-ascii?
  "Is CH a printable ASCII character? CH is a JVM Character or, on
  ClojureScript, a one-character string -- `seq` over a string yields
  different things on the two hosts.

  This was `#(<= 0x20 (int %) 0x7e)`, which is correct on the JVM and SILENTLY
  WRONG on ClojureScript. `(first \"_callee\")` is the STRING \"_\" there, and
  `(int \"_\")` returns 0 -- not an error, not a character code, just 0. So the
  range test failed for every symbol, `validate!` answered
  `:non-canonical-request` for every relocation, and NO Mach-O object could be
  emitted on the JVM-free runtime at all. Measured 2026-09-08 through
  kotoba-native's `shared-relocations-reach-real-macho-records` the first time
  it ran under nbb:

    request  {:reloc/target :aarch64 :reloc/type :aarch64/branch26
              :reloc/symbol \"_callee\" ...}
    JVM      accepted
    nbb      relocation rejected: non-canonical-request

  `(int <one-character string>)` returning 0 rather than throwing is what made
  it silent, and it is the exact shape
  `scripts/verify-cljc-runtime-parity.cljs` flags as `risky-mapv-int-over-string`
  in the superproject."
